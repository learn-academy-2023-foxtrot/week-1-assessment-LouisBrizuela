# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: github is a website; git is a system that lets you handle version control

Researched answer: git is a version control system that lets you manage your source code, github is a hosting service that allows you to manage your git repositories

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: &&, ||, ===, !, <=, >=, <, >

Researched answer: also includes ==, !==, !=, these are operators that return a value of either true or false

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: an arrays index is its location according to the arrays length, its value is the contents of the array

Researched answer: value is an element that is stored in the arrays index, index is the location of the arrays elements.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: arrays can store a collection of elements with different data types, both can output numbers and string but a "string" will only output a string even numbers will be interpreted as a string by the machine. an array can store numbers and the machine will still view it as a number. both hold a data type and can be used to send information to the user

Researched answer: An array is a list that holds a group of elements of the same data type. a string is a collection of characters that are defined by having quotation marks around the characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: pair programming is when 2 (or more) people work together to work on a line of code, one will be a "driver" and the other (or rest) will be "navigators". the navigator tells the driver what to type, the driver can have a say on what will be typed but the navigator will direct the majority of the code. good techniques would be to switch after a fair amount of work has been done, listening to your drivers ideas, keeping each other on track, explaining to your driver your logic and asking each other for help if needed.

Researched answer: pair programming forces you to practice your coding vocab and talk out loud your problems, catch mistakes and produce high quality code, work towards your strengths and improve your weaknesses.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: pre built in methods that take functions as arguments.

2. Jest: is a testing framework made to make sure any javascript code is working.

3. Objects: this data type can perform actions with methods or hold info. This data type has a behavior and stores data
